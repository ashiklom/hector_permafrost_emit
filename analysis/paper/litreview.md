# Literature review 

## Climate changes

- Arctic is warming more than twice as fast as global average, around 0.6 C per decade over last 30 years [@ipcc_ar5_wg1]
- Permafrost is warming everywhere [@biskaborn_2019_permafrost]

## Implications and relevance

- Permafrost thaw modifies surface terrain and hydrology
    - Erosion of coastal, lake, and river bluffs, and thawing ice wedges and erosion gullies (using multi-temporal LiDAR, along Alaska Beaufort Sea) [@jones_2013_quantifying]
    - Development of gully networks (Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada), with significant erosion and consequences for local hydrology including changes in channel configuration, flow rates, and hydrological connectivity [@godin_2014_effects]
    - Changes in thermokarst lakes and transitions from high-center to low-center polygons due to ice wedge degradation (Kubuk Valley National Park, Alaska) [@necsoiu_2013_multitemporal]
    - Leads to hazards and damage to infrastructure [@anisimov_1997_permafrost; @nelson_2002_climate]
- Changes in wetland and lake abundance -- initial thaw leads to lake and wetland expansion, followed by widespread disappearance caused by "breaching" of permafrost [@smith_2005_disappearing]
- Economic impacts
    - Permafrost C feedback increases estimated economic impact of climate change by 4-5% (\$25-67 trillion; out to 2300), depending on scenario (using PAGE-ICE model) [@yumashev_2019_climate].
    - CO2 and CH4 emissions from permafrost thaw lead to losses of \$2.5 (RCP4.5-SSP1) to \$12.7 (RCP 8.5-SSP3) trillion between 2010 and 2100 [@chen_2019_economic]

## Permafrost characteristics

- Overall review of permafrost [@grosse_2016_changing] 
- Spatial extent
    - 17% of Earth's exposed land surface -- 22 +/- 3 million km2 [@gruber_2012_derivation]
    - 10.5 million km2, estimated by CCSM3 in agreement with observations [@lawrence_2005_projection]
    - 24% of Northern Hemisphere land surface; 22.79 million km2 [@zhang_1999_statistics]
- C storage
    - High-latitude soil organic matter pool is 1300 (1100 - 1500) Pg, with ~800 Pg in permafrost and ~500 Pg in non-frozen soils [@hugelius_2014_estimated].
    - 65-70% (1035 +/- 150 Pg) in surface layer (0 - 3m) [@hugelius_2014_estimated] (compared to 2050 Pg organic C in the rest of the world; @jobbagy_2000_vertical).
    - 25-30% in deeper soils (> 3 m), due to unique processes -- e.g. Siberia and Alaska were ice-free during last Ice Age, so they accumulated silt (loess) soils that buried large quantities of organic matter deep in permafrost [@strauss_2013_deep]
- Drivers of thaw variability
    - Anthropogenic geological disturbance, such as geophysical exploration, increases thaw depths [@williams_2013_linear]
    - Vegetation cover -- warm permafrost retained in areas with peat or thick organic mats [@james_2013_multidecadal] and similarly where there is a thicker organic layer (but not in deep organic soils, such as those in wetlands) [@johnson_2013_permafrost]
    - Snow cover and duration (including timing) [@marmy_2013_permafrost]
    
## C fluxes in permafrost landscapes

- Tundra may be C-neutral or even a small C sink (0.013 Pg C year-1); based on synthesis of atmospheric inversion models and flux observations [@mcguire_2012_assessment]
- Tundra is a small C source (0.462 Pg C year-1); based on meta-analysis of 40 years of CO2 flux measurements across 32 sites [@belshe_2013_tundra]
- Some discrepancies may be explained by wetland ecosystems (included in @mcguire_2012_assessment, but not in @belshe_2013_tundra) -- they store more C in anaerobic soils and act as sinks even though they emit CH4 [@lund_2010_variability]
- Airborne measurements give a more aggregate picture; based on measurements in Alaska, tundra was a net CO2 source while boreal forests were neutral or a net sink (but with higher variability because of more dynamic photosynthesis and respiration, and because of fire). Alaska as a whole estimated to be a net C source (0.025 +/- 0.014 Pg C year-1) [@commane_2017_carbon]. Extrapolates to 0.3 Pg C year-1 for the whole Arctic.
- Arctic observations are biased to the summer; better accounting for winter CO2 emissions suggests emissions are twice as high -- 0.6 Pg C year-1 [@natali_2019_large]

## Model predictions
  
- Spatial extent
    - 4.0 (1SD = 2.9-5.0) million km2 per deg C of global mean warming "at stabilization" [@chadburn_2017_observation] (based on methodology by @gruber_2012_derivation). This result is higher than results from CMIP5 models.
    - By 2100, as little as 1 million km2 (10% of permafrost area), estimated by CCSM3 [@lawrence_2005_projection]
    
## Caveats

- Additional sources of complexity 
    - Landscape heterogeneity can affect the rates of CO2 [@turetsky_2002_boreal] and CH4 [@wickland_2006_effects] release
    - More than just frozen or not; possible presence of a "transition" layer [@shur_2005_transient_layer]
    - Responses of vegetation communities to permafrost thaw are complex and variable [@camill_2001_changes] 
    - Permafrost warming rate is nonlinear -- permafrost near O C warms slower because larger fraction of heat consumed by phase transition; this allows permafrost to persist somewhat longer under a warming climate [@romanovsky_2010_permafrost; @smith_2010_thermal]
